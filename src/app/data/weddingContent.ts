      "Well, he did. We started talking, and then he asked for my number and we went our separate ways. I was certain I would never hear from him again. I thought about him often, but eventually he faded into the ‘missed connections’ category. A few months later, out of the blue, he sent me [a message that said] ‘Happy New Year.’ We hit it off like nothing ever changed.",
